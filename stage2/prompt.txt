Start response with very laconic one line overview of changes done.

Let's think how to refactor coder to introduce new features:
- REPL command
    - should take list of files like other commands, but also allow to add/drop them interactively
    - use commands like /commit
    - keep conversation history and include it in LLM request
- streaming LLM response
    - needs to abort request on Ctrl-C, don't crash whole program
- improved commit message generation (run another query with LLM, just feed it user prompt + `git show`)
- don't use external files for prompt templates 
- make sure that when commiting:
    - the changes are applied to correct files (filename parsed from response)
    - new files created if necessary
